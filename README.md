# TaskZen (Task Management System) Website Design Using Core React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI & MongoDB

TaskZen is a Task Management Application where users can add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks using a drag-and-drop interface. Tasks will be categorized into three sections: To-Do, In Progress, and Done. Changes must be saved instantly to the database to maintain persistence.
